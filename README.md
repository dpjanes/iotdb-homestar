# About

Home☆Star is three things:

* it's the command line management utilities for [IOTDB](https://github.com/dpjanes/node-iotdb)
* it makes a web interface / API to your Things (if you want it)
* it's a naming convention for all IOTDB Bridges, e.g. homestae-hue

All our documenation is in the IOTDB project. To find out more:
